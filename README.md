Team Foundation Server plugin for Qt Creator
============================================

Requirements
------------
Either
* Team Explorer (only tested with 2012 edition)
  - http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30656
Or
* Visual Studio (only tested with 2012 edition)

Some basic functionality works with Team Explorer Everywhere, but it does not have the GUI components that the regular tf.exe has.

Features
----------------
* Import project from Team Foundation Server
* Add/Delete/Undo/Get latest
* Compare/Annoate/History/Check in
  - These work a little differently than other source control plugins for Qt Creator, because they reuse the GUI offered by tf.exe.

Installation
------------
* Either compile from source (you will need to compile Qt Creator from source and modify TeamFoundation.pro to point to it), or use the binaries from
  - Qt Creator 3.0: http://www.oktet.net/files/teamfoundation.zip.
  - Qt Creator 3.1  http://www.oktet.net/files/teamfoundation310.zip
* Put the binaries in a folder named TeamFoundation in Qt Creators plugins directory (default is C:\Qt\Tools\QtCreator\lib\qtcreator\plugins)
